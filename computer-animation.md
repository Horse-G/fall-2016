### Grading
85% is based on weekly assignments
	- they all receive equal weight
15% final exam
	- 4/5 should be straightforward if you did the homework

#### Due Dates
Due dates will be listed online
1% grade loss for every 6 minutes it is late
	- 2 hours late is 20%
	- 10 hours and everything is gone

#### Grading & Pardon Policy
Two homeworks with the lowest grades will get doubled grades, at the end of the semester
Class will not curve down. He may curve up if he feels like it.
Pluses and minuses are up to Grinspun's discretion.

### A Brief History of Animation

#### Persistence of Vision
The illusion of motion through showing a series of images in the same place.
Pantomimes Lumineuses, Theatre Optique de E Reynaud

#### History
1937, Snow White - the 7th feature length animated movie
	- Announced in 1934
	- Called "Disney's Folly" because of going overbudget and behind schedule

Cell shading worked really well, until computer showed up

#### Birth of Computer Animation
1963, Sutherland's Sketchpad
	- the first CAD tool
	- the guy got a Turing award, not for this sketchpad though

### Themes
	- integration of ordinary differential equations
	- discontinuities (fractures and collisions)
	- rigid bodies
	- elastic bodies
	- fluids
	- controlling the physics
#### I: Mass Spring Systems
	- objects with position, mass, initial velocity
	- apply a force to see the change in position of the object
#### II: Collisions & Fractures
	- what happens to objects when they bounce
	- reflection
	- coefficient of restitution
#### III: Rigid Bodies
	- Landslides
	- Fracture events
#### IV: Plasto-visco-elasticity
	- Finite Element Method
	- Discrete Differential Geometry
#### V: Smoke & Liquids (Fluids)
	- Navier-Stokes equation
	- Shallow water equations
