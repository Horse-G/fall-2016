1. My first computer was when I was ~10 years old. It was a Microsoft desktop, I think an HP.
It's been so long at this point, that I don't remember any other specifics about it.

2. I've had to learn just the bare minimum of Linux/Unix commands to get through a couple courses.
'ls' and 'cd', to name a few. I have also recently installed Ubuntu on an old computer, so I have
been dealing with 'sudo apt-get install' a bit.

3. At some point I do plan to migrate entirely to Linux, and the one thing that precludes me is
not knowing how to use Linux.

4. To know a critical mass of Linux terminal commands to be an efficient user and, more importantly,
not be scared of using terminal commands.
