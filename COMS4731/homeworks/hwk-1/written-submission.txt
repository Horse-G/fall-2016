Problem 1: Considering a pinhole camera with perspective projection.
	a.
	b. Since the area(A) is 1 mm^2, it's radius must be sqrt(A/PI). From now on we will call this number PHI.
		The diameter is therefore 2*PHI.
		With an arbitrary value Q, and all units in mm, we can define:
		Two points equidistant from each other on the circumference (marking the diameter) of this image would then be (Q,Q) and (Q,Q+2*PHI).
		Knowing the relations 'xi/f = xo/zo' and 'yi/f = yo/zo', where subscript i stand for image dimensions, and subscript o stand for object dimensions,
		And knowing that zo = 1 m = 1000 mm
		We can compute the same positions along the circumference for the actual disk:
			Q/f = xo1/zo -> xo1 = Q*zo/f
			Q/f = yo1/zo -> yo1 = Q*zo/f
			Q/f = xo2/zo -> xo2 = Q*zo/f
			(Q+2*PHI)/f = yo2/zo -> yo2 = (Q+2*PHI)*zo/f
		And find them to be: ( (Q*zo/f),(Q*zo/f) ) and ( (Q*zo/f),((Q+2*PHI)*zo/f) ).
		
		If then zo is doubled, we can reverse the process to find the corresponding points on the new image.
			xi1/f = (Q*2*zo/f)/(2*zo) -> xi1 = Q
			yi1/f = (Q*2*zo/f)/(2*zo) -> yi1 = Q
			xi2/f = (Q*2*zo/f)/(2*zo) -> xi2 = Q
			yi2/f = ((Q+2*PHI)*2*zo/f)/(2*zo) -> yi2 = Q+2*PHI
		
		The new image points are (Q,Q) and (Q,Q+2*PHI).
		The diameter of the new circle is the vector (Q,Q)-(Q,Q+2*PHI) = (0,2*PHI). The vector's length can then be computed as 2*PHI.
		The radius of the new circle is PHI.
		The area of the new circle = PI*(PHI^2) = PI*(sqrt(A/PI)^2) = PI*(A/PI) = A.
		The are of the new circle is the same as the area of the old circle.

Problem 2:
The prompt requests the we derive the equation for the hyperfocal distance 'H' of an imaging system.
We know the following equation is true, and represents part of the Depth of Field of a system:

c = (f^2 * (o2 - o))/(N * o2 * (o - f))

Where 'c' is the blur circle diameter, 'f' is the focal length, 'o2' is the farthest distance in a system where objects are in focus, and 'N' is f-number of the lens in the system.

We can identify 'o' as equivalent to 'H', and will therefore restructure our equation with 'H' on one side:

H = ((f^2)/(N*c))* ((o2 - H)/o2) + f

We know that in a hyperfocal system 'o2' must be an infinite value. To better understand how it can be represented in the function, let's take its limit of the function as o2 -> infinity:

lim(o2->inf)[(o2 - H)/o2] = 1

Therefore, our equation for 'H' can be simplified to:

H = (f^2)/(N*c) + f

Which we can identify as the equation we needed to prove.
Given the general equation for the Depth of Field of an imaging system,
	and given that the farthest distance in focus in a hyperfocal system is infinite,
	we have deduced the specific equation for finding the hyperfocal distance in an imaging system.
